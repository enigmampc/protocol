How to use this Documentation
=============================

This documentation is designed to help developers set up 
the Enigma Protocol testnet, learn how to write their first secret
contracts as well as how to deploy a responsive user interface. 
This is followed up by a few sections which define our current software 
architecture and the different components of the Enigma system.

This is a living document, and we encourage discussion and debate on our
`developer forum <https://forum.enigma.co/>`__ in order to make quality
modifications and additions in future revisions.

Getting Hands-on with the Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :doc:`getting started <GettingStarted>` section will walk you through
the system requirements and dependencies of the Enigma Docker Network, as 
well as comprehensive step-by-step instructions which outline how to configure 
your working folder and initiate your first secret contract deployment. After 
completing this page, you will be ready to start playing with the code.

The :doc:`writing a secret contract <SecretContracts>` page includes full 
break-downs on simple code examples for various problems that the Enigma 
protocol can solve for. These are intended to give dApp developers a real-world 
understanding of the underlying logic and potential of the network in their 
development process.

Lastly in the hands-on portion, the :doc:`creating a React front-end 
<CreateReactFrontend>` section will explain how to rapidly deploy a responsive 
graphical user interface for the prior examples (or whatever else you will build!).

Understanding the Enigma Protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

High-level information
```````````````````````
* The :doc:`network topology <NetworkTopology>` section displays the different components of the Enigma Docker Network release. 

* The :doc:`system design <SystemDesign>` page provides a high-level overview of the protocol itself.

Low-level information
``````````````````````
Both the
:doc:`software architecture <SoftwareArchitecture>` and
:doc:`subsystem architecture <SubsystemArchitecture>` sections describe in 
detail the current implementations of these components.

Learning about Enigma's Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Explore our :doc:`cryptography appendix <Enigma_Protocol_Cryptography>`
* How are you handling :ref:`key generation and management <client-encryption-and-storage>`?
* Read about Enigma's JavaScript client library, :doc:`Enigma-JS <Enigma-js>`
