How to use this Documentation
=============================

This documentation is designed to help developers get started with
the Enigma Protocol testnet, as well as defining our current software 
architecture and outlining the different parts of the Enigma system.

A practical :doc:`getting started <GettingStarted>` section walks
through the development process of a secret contract. The
:doc:`system design <SystemDesign>` section describes the different components
of the Enigma protocol at a high level. Both
:doc:`software architecture <SoftwareArchitecture>` and
:doc:`subsystem architecture <SubsystemArchitecture>` sections describe in 
detail the current implementations of these components.

This is a living document, and we encourage discussion and debate on our
`developer forum <https://forum.enigma.co/>`__.

**How do I develop my first secret contract?**

Get your feet wet with the :doc:`getting started <GettingStarted>`, which will
walk you through installing the docker network and writing your first secret
contract.

- Jump right into the :doc:`Enigma.js client library <Enigma-js>`
- Learn about the :ref:`Enigma Contract <enigma-contract>`, which enables secret contracts using Ethereum.

**Iâ€™m looking for the big picture of developing on Enigma.**

The :doc:`System Design <SystemDesign>` section breaks down the layers of
developing on Enigma.

**Where can I find more information on the protocol architecture?**

- Check out our :doc:`Software Architecture Overview<SoftwareArchitecture>` to
  see how the pieces fit together.
- See the :doc:`Network Topology <NetworkTopology>` of this release

**Where can I learn more about Enigma's encryption?**

- Explore our :doc:`cryptography appendix <Enigma_Protocol_Cryptography>`
- How are you handling :ref:`key generation and management <client-encryption-and-storage>` ?

**What kind of products can I build with Enigma?**
