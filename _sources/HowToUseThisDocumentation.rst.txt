How to use this documentation
=============================

This documentation is designed to help developers get started with
Enigma, describe our current software architecture, and clarify the
different parts of the Enigma system.

A practical “\ **getting started**\ ” section walks through the
development process of a secret contract. The “\ **system design**\ ”
section describes the different components of Enigma at a high level.
Both “\ **software architecture**\ ” and “\ **subsystem
architecture**\ ” sections describe in detail the current
implementations of these components.

This is a living document, and we encourage discussion and debate on our
**developer forum**.
